JabRef helps you to collect and organize sources, find the paper you need and discover the latest research.

## Onboarding experience

Choosing a project was a time-consuming task for us. First, we wanted to keep the project we worked on 
for assignment 3 (Scrapy), however we found that the issues seemed to difficult for us 
to resolve. Helped by the following list of open-source projects : https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners. 

We had to search for a few hours to find a project with a reactive community, opened
to assign issues to beginners, and with good documentation. We finally found JabRef which met
all of our criteria.
